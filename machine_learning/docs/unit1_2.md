## Feedback by Daisy

Thanks, Abdulhakim, for pointing out the impacts of the Marriott breach. In the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), incidents like the Marriott data breach highlight significant reputational risks for companies. This era, characterized by rapid technological advancements in AI and digital technologies, demands heightened attention to data security and ethical practices.

The Marriott breach exemplifies how a major data security incident can severely impact a company's reputation. In the digital phase where data is a crucial asset, the ability to protect customer information is directly linked to customer trust and brand perception. Such breaches not only result in immediate customer distrust but also invite scrutiny regarding a company's data management and security protocols. Furthermore, the evolving role of AI and machine learning in business operations introduces additional reputational risks.

The ethical use of AI, especially in handling sensitive data, is vital. Any perception of bias or misuse of AI can lead to significant reputational damage. According to Khan et al. (2021), the most frequently reported challenging factors are lack of ethical knowledge and vague principles. Companies must ensure that their AI systems are transparent and fair, avoiding any actions that could lead to public backlash.

Additionally, the 4IR has conducted in a shift towards more virtual and digital work environments. This transition brings its own set of challenges, particularly in maintaining effective team dynamics and ensuring robust cybersecurity in remote settings. The skills required for successful collaboration in virtual teams are essential, as failures in this area can lead to security lapses or project inefficiencies, further harming a companyâ€™s reputation.
