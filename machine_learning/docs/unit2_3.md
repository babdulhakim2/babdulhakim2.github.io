## AI-Driven Writing Tools: A Double-Edged Sword

The recent exploration of AI-driven writing tools unveils a complex interplay between technological advancements and ethical dilemmas. GPT-3, as highlighted by Hutson (2021), stands at the forefront of this development, offering significant benefits in automating writing tasks and fostering creativity, yet it also presents substantial risks such as bias, intellectual property issues, and a lack of deep understanding. Hutson (2021) emphasises GPT-3's potential in enhancing administrative efficiency and acting as a muse in creative endeavours. However, concerns arise regarding the perpetuation of biases (Bender et al., 2021), the blurring lines of authorship (Broussard, 2019), and the technology's superficial grasp of content (Marcus and Davis, 2020).

This dual-edged nature calls for ongoing research, ethical oversight, and robust frameworks to harness AI's capabilities responsibly.
