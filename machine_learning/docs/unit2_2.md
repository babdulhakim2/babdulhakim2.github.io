## Advanced Detection and Watermarking in AI-Generated Content

Thank you, Ahmed,

Indeed, while images and videos have seen advancements in watermarking and detection techniques, ensuring the authenticity of text remains a significant challenge. Mitchell et al. (2023) developed DetectGPT, a novel approach that uses the curvature of a model's log probability function to detect machine-generated text without requiring a separate classifier or explicit watermarking. This method significantly improves the detection of fake news articles generated by large language models, showcasing an innovative direction in text authenticity verification (Mitchell, E., Lee, Y., Khazatsky, A., Manning, C. D., & Finn, C., 2023).

On the other hand, Kirchenbauer et al. (2023) proposed a watermarking framework specifically for proprietary language models, embedding signals into generated text that are undetectable to humans but can be algorithmically identified. This framework demonstrates the potential for watermarking in mitigating the harms of large language models, though its application to text presents unique challenges not found in visual media (Kirchenbauer, J., Geiping, J., Wen, Y., Katz, J., Miers, I., & Goldstein, T., 2023).
