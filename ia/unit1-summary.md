# Unit 1: Introduction to Agent-Based Computing

## Overview

Unit 1 examines the trends in computing that have led to the rise of agent-based computing and introduces the fundamental concept of an intelligent agent. The unit explores why intelligent agents have gained popularity across various sectors and applications in today's technological landscape.

## Key Concepts

- **Multi-agent Systems**: Collective systems where multiple agents interact to solve problems beyond individual capabilities
- **Definition of an Agent**: Autonomous computational entities that perceive their environment and act to achieve defined goals
- **Agent in an Environment**: How agents sense, interpret, and respond to their operational context
- **Autonomy**: The capability of agents to operate without direct intervention, controlling their actions and internal state

## Learning Outcomes

- Develop understanding of key concepts of agent-based computing
- Understand the trends that have facilitated the development of agents as a paradigm
- Compare different types of agent-based systems to contrast their relative merits

## Reflection Notes

Agent-based systems represent a paradigm shift in computing, moving away from centralized control towards distributed, autonomous entities. Wooldridge (2009, p.21) defines an agent as "a computer system that is situated in some environment, and that is capable of autonomous action in this environment in order to meet its delegated objectives."

The rise of agent-based approaches has been driven by several technological trends, particularly the growth of distributed systems and the need for flexible, adaptive computing solutions. As noted by Wooldridge (2009, p.23), agents are especially valuable in environments that are "inaccessible, non-deterministic, dynamic, and continuous," making them applicable across domains from e-commerce to industrial control systems.

A key distinguishing feature of agents is their autonomyâ€”their ability to act without direct intervention and to control their own internal state (Wooldridge, 2009). This autonomy enables agents to operate effectively in complex, changing environments where predefined responses would be insufficient.
