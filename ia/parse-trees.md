# Creating Parse Trees

## Overview

This activity demonstrates the creation of constituency-based parse trees for three example sentences. Constituency parsing breaks sentences down into their constituent parts based on a context-free grammar, revealing the hierarchical structure of language and showing how words combine to form phrases and complete sentences.

## Example Sentences

For this activity, we are creating constituency-based parse trees for the following sentences:

1. The government raised interest rates.
2. The internet gives everyone a voice.
3. The man saw the dog with the telescope.

## Parse Tree Implementations

### Sentence 1: "The government raised interest rates."

```
                    S
                 ___|___
                |       VP
                |    ___|___
                NP   |     NP
             ___|___ |  ___|___
            |       ||  |     |
            DET     N  V     N     N
            |       |  |     |     |
           The government raised interest rates
```

**Analysis**: This sentence has a straightforward structure with "The government" forming a noun phrase (NP) that serves as the subject. The verb phrase (VP) contains the verb "raised" and the object noun phrase "interest rates." The parse tree clearly shows the subject-verb-object relationship.

### Sentence 2: "The internet gives everyone a voice."

```
                        S
                     ___|___
                    |       VP
                    |    ___|_____________
                    NP   |       |        NP
                 ___|___ |       NP    ___|___
                |       ||    ___|___  |     |
                DET     N V  DET     N DET   N
                |       | |  |       | |     |
               The internet gives everyone a   voice
```

**Analysis**: In this sentence, "The internet" forms the subject noun phrase. The verb phrase includes the verb "gives" followed by two noun phrases: "everyone" (indirect object) and "a voice" (direct object). This tree demonstrates the ditransitive structure where something is given to someone.

### Sentence 3: "The man saw the dog with the telescope."

**Interpretation 1**: The man used the telescope to see the dog.

```
                        S
                     ___|___
                    |       VP
                    |    ___|___________
                    NP   |             PP
                 ___|___ |       ______|______
                |       ||      |             |
                DET     N V     NP            NP
                |       | |  ___|___      ____|____
                |       | | |       |    |         |
                DET     N V DET     N   DET        N
                |       | | |       |   |          |
               The     man saw the    dog with    the telescope
```

**Interpretation 2**: The dog has a telescope.

```
                        S
                     ___|___
                    |       VP
                    |    ___|___
                    NP   |     NP
                 ___|___ |  ___|_____________
                |       ||  |                PP
                |       ||  |          ______|______
                |       ||  |         |             |
                DET     N V DET       N            NP
                |       | | |         |        ____|____
                |       | | |         |       |         |
                DET     N V DET       N      DET        N
                |       | | |         |      |          |
               The     man saw the    dog   with the telescope
```

**Analysis**: This sentence demonstrates syntactic ambiguity. In the first interpretation, "with the telescope" attaches to the verb phrase, indicating the instrument used for seeing. In the second interpretation, "with the telescope" attaches to the noun phrase "the dog," suggesting the dog possesses the telescope. This ambiguity highlights why parse trees are essential for understanding potential interpretations of natural language.

## Significance in NLP

Constituency-based parse trees provide several benefits for NLP systems:

1. **Ambiguity Resolution**: As shown in Sentence 3, parse trees can identify and represent different possible interpretations of ambiguous sentences.

2. **Structural Relationships**: The trees reveal hierarchical relationships beyond simple word adjacency, which is crucial for understanding how meaning is composed.

3. **Grammatical Analysis**: They show how sentences conform to (or deviate from) the grammar rules of a language.

4. **Component Identification**: They facilitate the identification of important sentence components like subjects, objects, and modifiers.

Constituency parsing remains fundamental to many NLP tasks, including question answering, information extraction, and machine translation, where understanding the structural relationships between words is essential for accurate interpretation.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this activity, we develop skills in:

- Analyzing sentences according to grammatical structure
- Identifying phrase boundaries and hierarchical relationships
- Recognizing and representing syntactic ambiguity
- Understanding how structural analysis contributes to meaning interpretation
