# Collaborative Discussion 3: Deep Learning - Summary Post

## Summary Post: Ethical Imperatives in AI Alignment and Interpretability

_by Abdulhakim Bashir - Saturday, 19 April 2025, 6:19 PM_

In my initial post, I chose to focus on the deeper ethical concerns of AI alignment and interpretability rather than the more commonly discussed issues of bias, copyright, and misinformation that many colleagues addressed which are all valid and worth noting.

While generative AI tools demonstrate impressive creative capabilities, I highlighted that our primary ethical concern should be their trajectory toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) and the associated existential risks. A misaligned AGI pursuing goals detrimental to humanity represents a profound ethical challenge that extends beyond immediate social impacts (Bostrom, 2014).

I emphasized two critical dimensions: alignment—ensuring AI systems act in accordance with human values—and interpretability—understanding AI decision-making processes. These interrelated challenges are essential for detecting potential harmful behaviors and building systems that remain beneficial as they become more capable (Das & Rad, 2020).

Though many discussions in this forum centered on important but shorter-term concerns like copyright infringement and social biases, I maintain that addressing the fundamental challenges of alignment and interpretability is crucial for ensuring that increasingly powerful AI systems remain beneficial to humanity in the long term.
